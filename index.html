                    <div class="history-text">
                        <p>Toraja comes from the Bugis language, namely "To Riaja".
                            This word means people who live in the land above.
                        </p>
                        <p>The origin of the Toraja people is from the Gulf of 
                            Tonkin which lies between southern China and Vietnam. 
                            At first, the ancestors of the Toraja tribe inhabited 
                            coastal areas in Sulawesi before finally moving to the highlands.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>When Indonesia was controlled by the Dutch, namely 
                            in 1909, the Dutch Colonial called this tribe the 
                            Toraja Tribe. This tribe is famous for its funeral 
                            rituals, besides that this tribe is also famous for 
                            its wood carvings and its traditional house, namely 
                            the tongkonan.
                        </p>
                        
                        <!--<p>Prior to the 20th century, this tribe was completely 
                            untouched by the outside world and still adhered to 
                            animist beliefs. At that time this tribe was still 
                            living in autonomous villages. The arrival of the Dutch 
                            in the early 1900s had the aim of spreading Christianity.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>Over time, this tribe became increasingly open to the 
                            outside world, namely in the 1970s. After that Tana 
                            Toraja became a symbol of Indonesian tourism. Since the 
                            1990s the Toraja people have undergone a cultural 
                            transformation. The Toraja people, which used to adhere 
                            to animist beliefs, have now changed to Christian 
                            communities.

                        <p>The Toraja traditional house is called Tongkonan. 
                            This house is only occupied by aristocrats from 
                            the Toraja Tribe and is the center of life for 
                            the Toraja people.</p>
                        <p>
                            There is a folk tale that is believed by the 
                            Toraja people regarding the establishment of 
                            the first Tongkonan house. The Toraja people 
                            believe that the Tongkonan was first built in 
                            heaven with a total of 4 poles. 
                            Then the ancestors of the Toraja people came 
                            down to Earth and imitated the house and held 
                            a big ceremony.</p>
                        <p>  
                            Because it is a large and magnificent house, 
                            the construction of the Tongkonan house is a 
                            big, tiring job. Therefore, a Tongkonan house
                             was built by a large family together.</p>

                            Rambu Solo '. This ritual was only performed by 
                            aristocrats because it was very expensive. The 
                            funeral ceremony of the nobility was usually 
                            attended by hundreds of people. The event can

                        <p>Funeral ceremonies do not have to be carried out 
                            immediately after a family member has passed 
                            away, but can be done after weeks, even years 
                            after the death of the person concerned. This 
                            is intended so that the cost of the traditional 
                            funeral ceremony is collected, considering that 
                            this ceremony is very expensive.</p>

                            witness it. The buffaloes to be pitted will be

                            This dance is a symbol of grief, respect and 
                            to give encouragement to spirits for going on

                        <p>The first thing that is done is for a group of

                            be unique. This ceremony is a form of respect 
                            for their ancestors who have died. This honor 
                            is carried out in the form of cleaning corpses 
                            and changing clothes for the bodies of ancestors 
                            who have died. This ritual is held every 3-4 years.</p>
                        <p>This ceremony is carried out by visiting the 
                            graves of the ancestors, then removing their 
                            bodies which previously started with a kind

                            together. The bodies were then cleaned using 
                            a brush, then their clothes were changed using 
                            new clothes. Cleaning and changing the clothes 
                            of the body does not take long, which is about 
                            30 minutes. Then the bodies were put back into 
                            the cemetery. The ceremony ends with praying 
                            back and eating together while gathering between

                        <h3>Pango - Pango</h3>
                        <p>You will definitely feel amazed at the beautiful 
                            scenery here, because you will feel the 
                            sensation of being in a land above the clouds. 
                            Perhaps that is an apt description of the scene 
                            here.</p>
                        <p>In addition, it is called agro-tourism because 
                            you will be invited to tour the garden above the 
                            clouds. Tourists are also allowed to pick 
                            agricultural products such as Toraja coffee, corn, 
                            chocolate, and so on.</p>

                        <p>The pool in the middle of this protected forest 
                            area is water that comes from a mountain spring 
                            that is really clean. Visitors can immediately 
                            swim in this pool or jump from the surrounding 
                            cliffs.</p>
                        <p>Even though it is in the middle of the forest the 
                            facilities here are sufficient for you to take a 
                            shower and change your clothes. You will get lucky 
                            if when you swim then you encounter Masapi or eels 
                            that eaves are cramped.</p>
